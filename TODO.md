Things I might want to do
-see if it will work: change game creation to @user.build.games by changing GamesAdapter createGame route to users/1/games, or something like that
-add a sleeping cat to titlescreen with animation
-put map json data into api and pull map info from there to be fancier
-add animations for cat moving vertically with necessary changes to "magic/bullet" class for firing direction
-add a serializer later, more than likely
