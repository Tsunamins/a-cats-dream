Remember to do list:
-add a serializer later, more than likely
-add validations, various if exists statments to controllers where necessary
-remember when working with stats in game will have to pass back as integer, so will have to round
-may want different adapters - user, game, stat (ie. userAdapter, gameAdapter, statAdapter)

Current task list:


-1st game task - make main game file with a TitleScene refernce, make the title scene with click to start game play ability
