Remember to do list:
-add a serializer later, more than likely
-add validations, various if exists statments to controllers where necessary
-remember when working with stats in game will have to pass back as integer, so will have to round
-may want different adapters - user, game, stat (ie. userAdapter, gameAdapter, statAdapter)
-make sure using const where necc
-make a new, larger map, don't forget to change config width and height to maintain collision bounds

Current task list:
-**Now: try to make bullets a separate class file, then try to add player class
-**next: text click screen to play


-1st game task - make main game file with a TitleScene refernce, make the title scene with click to start game play ability

--2nd - make gameScene with map loaded for now

--3rd - add to UI area ability to create a new user via email

--add adapter info for user

--4th - connect new user to a new game and check api updates

--5th - continue building gamescene

--6th -- once stats are ready pass back to api test

--7th


Things I might want to do
-add a sleeping cat to titlescreen with animation
-put map json data into api and pull map info from there to be fancier
-add animations for cat moving vertically with necessary changes to "magic/bullet" class for firing direction
